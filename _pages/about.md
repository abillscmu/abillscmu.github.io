Right now I'm working on a Ph.D. advised by Venkat Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University. I've worked on projects modeling battery cost, degradation, and performance. I've worked on applications such as cell phones and personal electronics, electric vehicles, electric aircraft, and satellites. Mostly, I work in the Julia programming language, which I've adopted mostly due to it's speed, syntax, and the fantastic DifferentialEquations.jl suite of solvers.
